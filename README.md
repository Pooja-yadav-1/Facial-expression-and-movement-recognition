# Facial-expression-and-movement-recognition
Facial Expresion and Movement Pattern recognition using CNN model.
Facial expressions and movements is a significant area of study in the fields of computer vision and human-computer interaction. 
This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately recognize and classify facial expressions from a diverse dataset of different facial movement and expressions.
We utilize the MobileNetV2 architecture, known for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks, as the base model for feature extraction. 
The dataset comprises images categorized into seven distinct facial expressions: surprise, sad, neutral, happy, fear, disgust, and angry.
